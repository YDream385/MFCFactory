===================
Adding New Controls
===================

Below are the steps for adding new control support to the Dynamic UI
and Control Surface layers. We assume that you have a CWnd-derived
class that you wish to support. This could be a native MFC control,
an ActiveX wrapper, or a custom CWnd class.

1. Implement a new CWndControl-derived class in WndControl.h/.cpp.
   This should be a simple wrapper class whose main purpose is to
   maintain state. Just follow the example of the classes which
   have already been coded.

2. Add two static functions to WndFactory.cpp. One function for
   creating a new instance of the CWnd-derived class. And another
   function for creating a new instance of the CWndControl-derived
   class. These two functions must be registered in the CWndFactory
   constructor.
   
3. Implement a new ParseControl_XXX static method in ControlXml.h/.cpp.
   Register the method in the CControlXml constructor.
   
4. Add an entry for the new control to Example1.xml (which shows all of
   the currently supported controls) for testing purposes.
